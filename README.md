# FT-iT

## we proposed a stock price prediction model based on time–frequency domain collaborative analysis, named FT-iTransformer. The model incorporates a frequency domain feature extraction module and a multi-scale temporal convolution module (MSTCN module). Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and 1D-CNN are used to extract frequency do-main features from the input sequence, while the MSTCN module extracts time do-main features on multiple temporal scales to comprehensively capture temporal in-formation in stock prices. The extracted time-frequency domain features are then fused and fed into the iTransformer. Its self-attention mechanism analyzes relationships among multiple variables, and the feedforward network further captures temporal dependencies within the sequence, enabling accurate prediction of stock closing prices.
